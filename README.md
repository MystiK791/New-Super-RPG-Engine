# New-Super-RPG-Engine
A (upcoming) Unity Engine port of what was probably the best Scratch project I ever made (while I was still on the service): https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/589981827/

Currently this is an empty repository, as I haven't done any work on this project yet. However, I hope to have a prototype in a few months or so.
